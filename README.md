I wrote these Cypress scripts to test product substitution within SAP Hybris. It was created during my tenure at Phillip Morris International. Previously, testers performed this function manually. These scripts effectively duplicate the processes that the tester would take manually, but Cypress performs it more efficiently, with less human mistakes (because to the unfriendly user interface of SAP products), and much quicker. I've updated each new version with a newer version. We are currently utilizing the Version 4 template. For my manual tester colleagues, I designed an app that creates the Cypress script without requiring them to directly alter the code.
