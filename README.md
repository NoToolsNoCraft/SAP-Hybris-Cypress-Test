I've created these Cypress scripts for testing of product replacement inside of SAP Hybris. It was made during my engagement with Phillip Morris International. 
This feature used to be done manually by testers. 
These scripts basically simulates the steps the tester manually goes through, although Cypress does it more efficient, with less human-errors (related to the not most friendly user-interface of SAP products) and obviously much faster.
Every new updated version I've updated in a newer version. Currently we are using the version 4 template.
For my manual tester colleagues I have created an app that generates the Cypress script without they having to directly modify the code. You may check out the app here: https://notoolsnocraft.tech/Product-Replacement-Test-Script-Generator/
